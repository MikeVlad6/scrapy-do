=====================================
Welcome to Scrapy Do's documentation!
=====================================

Scrapy Do is a daemon that provides a convenient way to run `Scrapy
<https://scrapy.org/>`_ spiders. It can either do it once - immediately; or it
can run them periodically, at specified time intervals. It's been inspired by
`scrapyd <https://github.com/scrapy/scrapyd>`_ but written from scratch. For
the time being, it only comes with a REST API. Version 0.2.0 will come with a
command line client, and version 0.3.0 will have an interactive web interface.
